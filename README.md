#### About Lendsqr
Lendsqr provides Lending-As-A-Service solutions to lenders, loan agencies or organisations to launch their lending service in the shortest time possible, scaling across multiple channels at the lowest cost. This test application creates a dashboard that shows a borrowers' list pulling data from a mock API with 500 records using local Storage or indexedDB. 

#### Dependencies/Tools
The dependencies and tools used include:
- React with TypeScript:
Typescript is a strongly typed language that adds additional syntax to Javascript in order to catch errors early.
** Installing React--
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Ensure that node and npm is installed first. From your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

Installing node and npm:

```bash
$ nvm use 16
Now using node v16.9.1 (npm v7.21.1)
$ node -v
v16.9.1
$ nvm use 14
Now using node v14.18.0 (npm v6.14.15)
$ node -v
v14.18.0
$ nvm install 12
Now using node v12.22.6 (npm v6.14.5)
$ node -v

```

Then install react using the same terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app lendsqr
```

lensqr being the name of the app in this case.
